# Desktop Screen Agent

## Important Things To Note:

- There is a collapsible menu on the left side for switching the displayed page of the desktop screen
  - Some menu items have sub menus in them
- The user can access the settings screen here in order to update the various settings for the overlays ect


## React Components & ts/tsx considerations
- If there are multiple related component files, then they should be grouped in their own folder within the components folder

## Css & style considerations
- Css files should be put in the correct /styles folder and not in the same folder as the component file.
